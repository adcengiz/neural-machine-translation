# Neural Machine Translation
Neural Machine Translation Project for NLP Class at NYU MS in Data Science

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a neural machine translation system and experience how recent advances have made their way. Each team will build the following sequence of neural translation systems for two language pairs, Vietnamese (Vi)→English (En) and Chinese (Zh)→ English (En).

### The Models
- Recurrent neural network based encoder-decoder without attention
- Recurrent neural network based encoder-decoder with attention
- Convolutional or self-attention based encoder.
- Self-attention translation system
- Multilingual translation system
